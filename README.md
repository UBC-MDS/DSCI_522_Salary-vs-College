# DSCI_522_Salary-vs-College

### About the dataset

We chose to analyze a dataset about the salaries of US college graduates organized by college, region, type and major. This is publicly available [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/wsj/college-salaries) on kaggle. The original data is from The Wall Street Journal.

### Our question

We decided to explore the dataset and ask whether there are any relationships between college region, type and major and graduates' salaries. This is an exploratory question.

### Our plan

1. Perform an exploratory data analysis of the dataset:  
    a. Look at salary by school region, type, and degree  
    b. Do a) for different salaries (starting salary, mid-career salary, etc.)  
    a. Use violin/jitter plots to visualise the distributions of the data  

2. If we see an particular patterns/differences in groups, we will quantify them using using hypothesis testing:  
    a. Use ANOVA to look for differences in the variables (school region, type, degree) that may impact graduates' salaries.
