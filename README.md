# DSCI_522_Salary-vs-College

We chose to analyze a dataset about the salaries of US college graduates organized by college, region and major. This is publicly available [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/wsj/college-salaries) on kaggle. The original data is from The Wall Street Journal.


Our plan:

First, we start with the exploratory data analysis based on the dataset we have, in terms of the region, school type, and the degree type;

Violin plot and jitter plot can be constructed to help us visual the distribution of the data;

When we see special patterns occur, we will further explore the data using hypothesis testing (ANOVA), to identify the sigificant difference.
